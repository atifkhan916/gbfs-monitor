Key improvements in this setup:

Environment Separation:

Uses Terraform workspaces to isolate state between environments
Separate .tfvars files for dev and prod configurations
Environment-specific S3 buckets for state storage


Security:

Environment-specific AWS credentials
Production deployments require manual approval
Separate state files for each environment


Maintainability:

Clear separation of environment-specific variables
Reusable core Terraform configuration
Easy to add new environments


State Management:

Uses S3 backend for state storage
Environment-specific state files
Workspace-based isolation



Configure QuickSight Console to Use the IAM Role
Since Terraform doesn’t directly support associating IAM roles with QuickSight data sources:

Go to AWS QuickSight console > Manage QuickSight.
Under Security & permissions, assign the IAM role (quicksight-s3-access-role) manually to grant access to the S3 bucket.
This setup enables QuickSight to use the IAM role’s permissions when accessing the specified S3 bucket. You only need to set up the IAM role association once in the QuickSight console.
